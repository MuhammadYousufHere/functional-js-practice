Imperative Versus Declarative

i=> Declarative programming is a style of programming where applications
are structured in a way that prioritizes describing what should happen over defining
how it should happen.

ii=> Imperative
programming, or a style of programming that is only concerned with how to achieve
results with code.


Functional Concepts

The core concepts
of functional programming are: immutability, purity, data transformation, higher-order
functions, and recursion.

Immutability:
To mutate is to change, so to be immutable is to be unchangeable. In a functional program,
data is immutable. It never changes.
Instead of changing the original
data structures, we build changed copies of those data structures and use them
instead.
